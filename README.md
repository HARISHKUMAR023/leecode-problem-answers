## Structure

Each problem solution is organized into its own directory. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A Question file , typically named `question.md` 
- A solution file, typically named `answer.md` in Python
- A README file providing a description of the problem, examples, constraints, and any additional notes.

## How to Use

You can browse through the directories to find solutions to specific problems. Each problem directory contains a README file with detailed explanations.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute by submitting more efficient solutions or suggesting improvements.
