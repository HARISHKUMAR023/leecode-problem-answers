### 1528. Shuffle String

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Topics:** 

**Companies:** 

**Hint:** 

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `ith` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

#### Example 1:

```python
# Example 1
s = "codeleet"
indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
# Output: "leetcode"

#### Example 2:

```python
# Example 2
s = "abc"
indices = [0,1,2]
# Output: "abc"
